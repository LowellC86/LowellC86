### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I am a passionate Software Engineering student currently attending General Assembly, and I am thrilled to embark on this new journey as a coder. But let me tell you a bit about my background that has shaped me into who I am today.

For the past five years, I have honed my skills as a line cook, meticulously crafting culinary delights with precision and creativity. This experience has ingrained in me a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and the ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment. As a line cook, I learned the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and problem-solving, skills that I believe will seamlessly transition into the world of software development. Additionally, I spent three years as a delivery driver, where I gained valuable insights into efficient logistics, time management, and customer satisfaction. This role allowed me to navigate complex routes, think on my feet, and maintain a calm demeanor under pressure. These qualities, coupled with my commitment to excellence, will undoubtedly benefit me as I delve deeper into the realm of coding. With my prior experiences as a line cook and delivery driver, I bring a unique perspective to my software engineering journey. I understand the significance of attention to detail, the importance of meeting deadlines, and the value of providing exceptional user experiences. As I transition into this new chapter, I am excited to leverage my diverse skill set and incorporate it into my coding projects. Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile!
